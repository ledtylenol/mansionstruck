/// A [`SystemParam`] for the *move and slide* algorithm, also known as *collide and slide* or *step slide*.
///
/// Move and slide is the core movement and collision algorithm used by most kinematic character controllers.
/// It attempts to move a shape along a desired velocity vector, while sliding along any colliders it hits on the way.
///
/// # Algorithm
///
/// At a high level, the algorithm works as follows:
///
/// 1. Sweep the shape along the desired velocity vector.
/// 2. If no collision is detected, move the full distance.
/// 3. If a collision is detected:
///    - Move up to the point of collision.
///    - Project the remaining velocity onto the contact surfaces to obtain a new sliding velocity.
/// 4. Repeat with the new sliding velocity.
///
/// The algorithm also includes depenetration passes before and after movement to ensure the shape is not intersecting any colliders.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// [`MoveAndSlideConfig`] allows configuring various aspects of the algorithm.
/// See its documentation for more information.
///
/// Additionally, [`move_and_slide`](MoveAndSlide::move_and_slide) can be given a callback that is called
/// for each contact surface that is detected during movement. This allows for custom handling of collisions,
/// such as triggering events, or modifying movement based on specific colliders.
///
/// # Resources
///
/// Some useful resources for learning more about the move and slide algorithm include:
